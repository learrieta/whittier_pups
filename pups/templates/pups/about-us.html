                Whittier Pups is a family run business by Jason and Jennifer Whittier and our 6 children located in Western MA (Hampden County).
                Jason and Jennifer grew up with dogs and knew when we had kids that we wanted our kids to experience the special bond between a child and a dog.
                We fell in love with the labrador retreiver breed after researching what would be the best fit for our family. Labrador Retreivers are gentle and docile with children and adults,
                eager to please, and overall a terrific addition to any family dynamic.

                We are a small (despite having 6 kids and number 7 on the way) family run breeder and we want to keep it that way. Our goal is to provide a special companion to each one of our forever homes. 
                Jason is a full time middle school ESL teacher and Jennifer is a stay at home mom. Our children range in age from 15 to 2 years old. Your new family member will have lots of hands on experience with kids and will come well socialized! We also have 2 cats that our puppies are always curious about.
